*BUGS AT BOTTOM*

    Next:
        (DONE) Implement cnf_introspect(); see work/test.dot

        Problem: The Graphviz layout is not very useful on uniform-random graphs.
        Implement introspect_sat_svg() for this case. Just formulate the
        variables as columns, clauses as rows and dump an adjacency matrix to
        SVG using the introspect_svg() approach from lib_babel.
